The goal is to finish the damn vulnerable defi v4 challenges.

starting with unstoppable, but off to a slow start as i spent the most of the days session on this level. but i learnt more about ERC-4626 and ERC-3156 standards used here

### 2024.08.30

today i wrapped up with the unstoppable challenge, and completed one more challenge (Side Entrance), Currently working on the Puppet level. the notes are <https://github.com/sudotx/Web3-CTF-Intensive-CoLearning/blob/main/Writeup/sudotx/DamnVulnerableDefi>

### 2024.08.31

Today the study session focus was on clearing the puppet, puppetv2 and puppetv3 contracts as they relate to the 3 iterations of the uniswap v2 contract. i did mostly research into price manipulation attacks using this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnC2Z-ZZow> it was mostly research since the ideas i tried did not work.
