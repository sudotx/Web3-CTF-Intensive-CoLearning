# Challenge - Truster

More and more lending pools are offering flashloans. In this case, a new pool has launched that is offering flashloans of DVT tokens for free.

The pool holds 1 million DVT tokens. You have nothing.

## Objective of CTF

To pass this challenge, rescue all funds in the pool executing a single transaction. Deposit the funds into the designated recovery account.

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Root Cause: Arbitrary Call

```solidity
function flashLoan(uint256 amount, address borrower, address target, bytes calldata data) external nonReentrant returns (bool){
    uint256 balanceBefore = token.balanceOf(address(this));

    token.transfer(borrower, amount);
    target.functionCall(data);

    if (token.balanceOf(address(this)) < balanceBefore) {
        revert RepayFailed();
    }

    return true;
}
```

In this `flashLoan` function, we observe that it allows us to execute an arbitrary external call within the `TrusterLenderPool` contract, as shown in the following code snippet:

```solidity
target.functionCall(data);
```

In this scenario, an attacker can execute a token approval to their address during the flash loan process. Although the `flashLoan` function ensures the borrowed amount is repaid, it doesn’t prevent the attacker from later using the `transferFrom` function to move tokens from the `TrusterLenderPool` contract, leading to a potential loss of funds.

### Attack steps:

1. Execute a flash loan and include data to approve a specific address to spend `TrusterLenderPool`'s tokens.
2. Use the approved address to transfer tokens from `TrusterLenderPool` to the `recovery`.
